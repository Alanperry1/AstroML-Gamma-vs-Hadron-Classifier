# AstroML-Gamma-vs-Hadron-Classifier
AstroML is a machine learning project that classifies cosmic particle events from the MAGIC Gamma Telescope into gamma rays or hadrons. It uses supervised algorithms, KNN, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM to analyze and compare classical model performance on telescope-based astrophysical data.
